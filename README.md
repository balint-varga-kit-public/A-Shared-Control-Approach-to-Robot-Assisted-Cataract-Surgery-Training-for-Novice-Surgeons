The paper introduces a **virtual-fixture-based shared control method** for robot-assisted cataract surgery training. The approach provides haptic force feedback (FF) to guide a teleoperated scalpel toward the incision point and to protect the posterior corneal surface, evaluated in a simulator-based initial validation study. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
